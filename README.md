# Install

### Prerequisites

* You need Java 8 to run the IDE so prior to execute the Synflow IDE, it is a good idea to install a flavor of Java 8 JDK.
* You also need Eclipse to run the IDE so download and install Eclipse for RCP and RAP developers.

### Set Up

A step by step explanation that tells you how to get your development environment up and running.

1. Clone the repository under Eclipse (Clone Repository)

2. Set Up Eclipse (Preferences => Workspace => Text File Encoding => UTF-8) and display the Git Repositories View (Eclipse => Show View => Git Repositories)

3. Install the plugins (Eclipse Modeling framework SDK, Graphical Editing Framework GEF SDK, MWE 2 Language SDK, MWE 2 Runtime SDK, Xtend IDE, Xtext Complete SDK)

4. Execute MWE 2 on the GenerateCx.mw2 class (Project Explorer => Synflow IDE => com.synflow.cx => src => com.synflow.cx => GenerateCx.mw2 ) by making a right click and selecting Run as => MWE 2 Workflow

5.  Configure the Product (Project Explorer => Synflow IDE => releng => ngDesign.product => Synchronize, and then Lunch an Eclipse Application - it will fail)

6.  Run the product (Run as => ngdesign.product => Plug-ins => Add Required Plug-ins, and then Apply and Run)

### Run and test it
