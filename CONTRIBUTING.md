### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and fix the bug.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. 

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitLab issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/). After you've determined which package your bug is related to, create an issue on that package and provide as much information as possible.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. 
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

Include details about your configuration and environment.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain ngDesign's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users

Please follow instructions provided by the mainteners to have your pull accepted.  The mainteners may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
